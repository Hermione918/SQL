#This project contains analytics questions and queries using SQLiteStudio.
#I also used "dealing with messy data" method.

~~1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)= 6
AND orderid<>'OrderID';

~~2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)= 6
AND orderid<>'OderID';

~~3. Select the customer acccount numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id= Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid)= 6
AND orderid<>'OrderID';

~~4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

~~5. What is total revenuefor each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

~~6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

~~7.  How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id= Feb.orderid
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)= 6
AND orderid<>'OrderID';


#This part, I utilized the advanced data filtering technique

~~1. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
