#Here are some questions and queries

~~1. Which 2 artists has the longest duration of music?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 2

~~2. Which songs have the highest energy levels of tracks?
SELECT track_name, MAX(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 5

~~3. What is the average popularity of songs across different genres
SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

~~4. What is the average danceability score of the top 5 most popular tracks
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;
